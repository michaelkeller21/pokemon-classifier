    "For the purposes of context for this report, Pokemon is shorthand for Pocket Monsters, and it is a Japanese video game series developed for Nintendo gaming systems. In it, the player goes on an adventure where they assemble a team of 6 creatures, train them up to become strong, and compete for the recognition of becoming the most powerful trainer in the game world. Players in Pokemon compete by battling them against each other. As of this writing, there are 890 unique Pokemon. The Kaggle dataset mentioned above contains only 809 Pokemon, and was not updated for the additional 81 Pokemon introduced in Pokemon Sword and Shield in November 2019.\n",

    "Each Pokemon has a primary and possibly a secondary type. For the purposes of complexity, we will only use the primary type of a Pokemon as a class label. There are 18 unique types of Pokemon, which each type having its own strengths and weaknesses in battle with respect to other types. Examples of types include Fire, Water, Grass, Ground, or Electric. We will investigate in this report the ability of a CNN to distinguish Pokemon by type based on their appearance in images."
